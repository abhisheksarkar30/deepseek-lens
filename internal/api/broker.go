// Package api is the JSON API (plus SSE push) behind the dashboard, and
// the embedded-asset mount for internal/web. Almost every route only
// reads; the exceptions are POST /api/requests/{id}/replay and POST
// /api/prices, each behind replayOriginReject's Origin/Host allowlist
// rather than the "read-only and loopback-bound" rationale the GET routes
// rely on. See CLAUDE.md's architecture essentials: "the dashboard
// listener reads SQLite and pushes SSE" — this package is that listener's
// handler.
