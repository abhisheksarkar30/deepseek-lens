// Package decode removes a captured body's transport Content-Encoding.
//
// lens tees the bytes the client and upstream actually exchanged, so a captured
// body arrives exactly as it went over the wire: compressed, whenever the client
// negotiated compression (Claude Code sends
// "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd", and the DeepSeek endpoint answers
// "Content-Encoding: br"). Parsing those bytes as-is is what made every
// compressed call report zero tokens and an unresolved model — internal/parse
// cannot read a brotli stream, so ExtractUsage found no usage event at all, and
// the dashboard showed the body as binary.
//
// Decoding belongs here, in the cold path, and deliberately not in
// internal/proxy: CLAUDE.md's "the proxy listener holds the hot path and does no
// parsing; it tees the bytes into a bounded sink and returns" is exactly the
// invariant that keeps decompression off the client's goroutine. A decoder
// inline in the tee would put the work back on the hot path, which is the one
// thing the TTFB test exists to prevent.

// Body returns body with h's Content-Encoding undone, and a copy of h with the
// headers that described the encoded form (Content-Encoding, Content-Length)
// removed — so the returned pair describes the returned bytes consistently.
// That consistency is what keeps a stored row replayable: internal/api's replay
// re-sends a row's stored body with that row's stored headers, so leaving a
// stale Content-Encoding behind would make a replay declare an encoding its
// body no longer has.
//
// Decoded output is capped at limit bytes, because the cap internal/proxy
// applies is on the *compressed* capture: 256KB of brotli can expand to many
// megabytes, so capping only the encoded form would let the configured
// per-body cap be exceeded by whatever ratio the upstream chose — and would
// make a crafted body an unbounded amount of work and storage.
//
// A body that decodes only partially (the proxy's cap cut the encoded stream
// short, which is common for a large streamed response) yields the decoded
// prefix and no error: some parsed usage beats none, and internal/parse already
// degrades rather than fails on a shape it cannot finish reading.
